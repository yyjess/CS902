Will the New Ban Go Up in Smoke?       
A new smoking ban―China’s toughest to date―took effect in Beijing on June 1. The new ban prohibits smoking in all of the city’s indoor public places， workplaces， and on public transportation. Additionally， the regulation bans smoking at outdoor public locations such as schoolyards.
    Owing to its past popularity and iconic status， smoking has influenced Chinese people’s daily lives in a number of different， often subtle， ways. Will the new regulation cause the habit to fade from public life？
    Statistics from the National Health and Family Planning Commission in 2014 showed that as the world’s largest tobacco producer and consumer， China has more than 300 million smokers. Over 740 million non-smokers are exposed to second-hand smoke annually. More than 1.36 million people die of smoke-related diseases every year， about 100，000 of which are non-smokers who have fallen victim to second-hand smoke. If no effective measures are taken， it is projected that over 3 million people will die of smoke-related diseases every year by 2050.
    Effectively enforcing a ban on smoking in public places has long been a hot issue for authorities. China started to implement smoking bans of various kinds as long ago as 1979. Since then， the country has been imposing smoking bans in more and more public places and detailing more and more regulations on prohibiting smoking at specific locations. Today， nearly 50 percent of Chinese cities have banned smoking in public places. These measures， however， have failed to have the desired effect.
    Beijing had previously introduced two smoking bans in late 1995 and May 2008. However， these bans were never enforced in earnest. Many smokers persisted in smoking in public places， even those sporting "No Smoking" signs.
    A certain kind of subculture has arisen from this individual habit， one of the reasons it is so difficult to ban. Smoking and drinking are an indelible part of Chinese social activities， owing to the value of the habits as social lubricants and their ability to create an instant bond between those who partake of them. Moreover， tobacco has become an essential cash crop in many localities in China， the prime reason that local governments are reluctant to prohibit smoking outright.
    The new regulation seems to have worked more effectively this time， owing to strong enforcement and widespread media coverage. Within the 15 days after it took effect， inspectors fined three organizations in Beijing a total of 6，000 yuan ($968) for not adequately implementing smoking control measures.
    Tough regulations， strong enforcement and the participation of the public are all essential to building a smoking-free environment. If Beijing’s new regulation works this time around， then the pace of progress in reducing smoking throughout the whole of China will undoubtedly quicken.

    Credit Is an Important Asset
    Under the "new normal" of the Chinese economy， the circumstances for real estate development， major project investment and investment promotion are undergoing changes. （Note: The "new normal" of the Chinese economy means the economy has shifted gear from previous high speed growth to medium-to-high speed growth； the economic structure is constantly improved and upgraded； and the economy is increasingly driven by innovation instead of investment.）
    The focus of competition among regional economies is also shifting from "hard factors" to distinctive features and a favorable environment.
    Distinctive features can be reflected in urban construction， cultural atmosphere， industries and resources. A favorable environment denotes a combination of ecological balance， comfortable living conditions， satisfying public services， propitious industrial development， sufficient human resources and good credit.
    In the future， a region’s competitiveness， to a large extent， will come from distinguishing features and the overall environment， instead of the input of "hard factors" like preferential tax policies， intense investments and industrial parks.
    Therefore， local governments should shift their focus from stimulating the market and encouraging project investment to fostering their own features and providing a favorable environment.
    A featureless region with a bad overall environment will find it hard to win sustainable development or attract talent， enterprises and investors to settle down.
    It’s expected that the local environment will become increasingly important in the competition among regions during the 13th Five-Year Plan period （2016-20）.
    In terms of environment construction， local governments are used to valuing a tangible rather than intangible environment. For instance， they tend to pay much attention to afforestation， ecological and urban environment， infrastructure and supporting facilities.
    Many local governments have been improving their services， which belong to the intangible environment， but another important factor of the intangible environment―the credit environment―has often been ignored.
    The credit environment of a region not only has to do with the credit of individuals and enterprises but also with that of the government. In most cases， government credit is of paramount importance to the local credit environment.
    In the days when local governments never worried about project financing and investment， the credit environment seemed not so important. However， things have changed since the economy entered the "new normal."
    Local governments should deem credit as part of their assets. These days， intangible assets like the credit environment are playing a dominant role over tangible assets such as resources， land， infrastructure， industrial parks and transportation facilities in attracting investment.
    Specifically， northwest China lags behind southeast coastal regions in credit building， which is basically in line with their development level of market economy.
    According to my knowledge， a southeastern enterprise once reached a deal with a northwestern state-owned enterprise （SOE） affiliated to the local state assets authority to jointly purchase and market Xinjiang-grown quality cotton. A coastal joint-stock bank was resorted to provide financing services for the two companies and had provided loans amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan. Yet， when the SOE manager and head of the local state assets authority were arrested for corruption， the local state assets authority tried to get rid of the debt by claiming the bankruptcy of the SOE. Out of this ulterior motive， the local state assets authority even mobilized economic police to investigate the case under the pretext of signing fake contracts. The joint-stock bank hasn’t got back the money despite numerous attempts. If the hundreds of millions of yuan turns into bad loans， the bank will suffer a lot and reputation of the local government will also suffer， which will undermine the future development of the region.
    Credit is essential to a market economy. While "hard factors" competition is cooling down， the status of "soft factors" is ascending. For this reason， local governments should safeguard their credit the same way they do to their tangible assets.
